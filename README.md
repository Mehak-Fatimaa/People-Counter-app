# People-Counter-app
This is a simple JavaScript project built as part of my Scrimba JavaScript course. The app allows users to increment a count each time a person enters and then save that count as a historical entry. It uses basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to manage dynamic updates and DOM manipulation.
